**Version \[0.5\]** has arrived! This update brings:
*   **TomTom support**: Introduce support of `TomTom` waypoints (by default: disabled). It can be turned on in the AddOn Settings to use TomTom waypoints instead of the Blizzard's Map Pin.
*   **Localization**: Add `zhCN` translation (thanks to `XingDvD` for contribution).
