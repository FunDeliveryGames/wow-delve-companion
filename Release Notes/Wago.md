**A new update** has arrived!
***
A new year is here, a new expansion is coming, and we have a perfect time to relax before the next season of the Delves.<br>
And remember Ky'veza only in nightmares...
***
**Version [2026.01.1]**:
- Prepare addon to Midnight.
    - It's unclear from the PTR how exactly TWW and Midnight Delves will co-exist. Presumably, TWW content will be a legacy for achievements and t-mog farm. But still accessible, with Brann and most features be the same.
    - I'll dig into this on the retail once the Pre-Patch update is here. And tweak the addon further to support both expansions.
- Add expansion selector to the Delves tab.
    - Now, Delves tab behave the same way as other tabs in the Adventure Guide.
    - You can use the selector to switch between TWW and Midnight Delves.
- Display Companion configuration widget, active Bountiful Delves, and Consumables in a new Delves Encounter window.
    - Delves UI has been removed.
    - Delve Season progress and Companion configuration has been moved to a new Journeys tab.
    - This part is still WIP, layout and content are subject to change.
