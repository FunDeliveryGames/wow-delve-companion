    - The widget can also be hidden at all from the settings.
- **Delves UI**: Add a progress bar to track Companion's current level and progress towards the next one.
- **Delves UI**: Add adaptive visuals for consumables to convey their emphasis or state (_e.g., [Delver's Bounty](https://www.wowhead.com/item=233071/delvers-bounty) icon will be desaturated if it has been looted and used this week_).
- Addon settings has been updated offering modifications without reloading the UI.
