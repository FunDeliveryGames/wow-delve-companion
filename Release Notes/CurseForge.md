**Version \[0.5.1\]** has arrived! This update brings:

*   **Delves UI**: Delve's Loot info window is not shown automatically anymore. There is a dedicated button to show it at the bottom right corner.
*   **Localization**: Add `zhTW` translation (thanks to `BlueNightSky` for contribution).
*   Fixed overlap of the Loot info window with RIO Profile tooltip.
