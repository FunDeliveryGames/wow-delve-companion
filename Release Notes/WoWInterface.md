[b]A new update[/b] has arrived!  It includes support for the upcoming 11.2 features.

[b]Version [0.9][/b]:
[list]
[*] [b]QoL[/b]: Track the active Story Variant for each Delve (thanks Blizzard for providing this information eventually).
    - It's displayed in a tooltip hovering over a Delve button (both in [b]Delves Tab[/b] and [b]Delves UI[/b]).
    - The tooltip also highlights whether this variant has been completed in the corresponding achievement or not.
[*] [b]Delves Tab[/b]:  If the active Story Variant hasn't been completed yet, there is an orange exclamation mark on the corresponding Delve button.
[*] Updated consumables and Caches for Season 3. Note:
    - In Season 3, only Caches for Weekly Quests and Ka'Resh activities contain [url=https://www.wowhead.com/currency=3028/restored-coffer-key]Restored Coffer Keys[/url].
    - Caches for activities of old zones (e.g. Theater Troupe) contain [url=https://www.wowhead.com/item=245653/coffer-key-shard]Coffer Key Shards[/url] instead (the same limit, 4 per week). The AddOn doesn't track such Caches at the moment.
[*] Removed the `Overcharged` modifier due to it being inactive in Season 3.
[*] [b]MapPinEnhanced support[/b]: Introduce support of `MapPinEnhanced` waypoints (by default: disabled). It can be turned on in the AddOn Settings.
    - At the moment, `MapPinEnhanced` API doesn't provide an option to remove created pins from other addons. Please use `MapPinEnhanced` directly to remove the created pins.
